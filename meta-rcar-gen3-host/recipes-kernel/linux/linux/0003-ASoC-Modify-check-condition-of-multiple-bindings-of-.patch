Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: Modify check condition of multiple bindings of
 components

https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/7385501/
...and some more hacks to bind one component (with several DAIs)
to more than one sound card.

KF has 4 sound cards (pcm3168a, ak4613, radio, wl18xx) and just one
compinent ec500000.sound that can not be bound to all 4 cards.
This is a lack of current implementation of sound/soc/sh/rcar/* ASoC stack
The ec500000.sound resources (PCM/DMA, dais) needs to be shared between
all 4 sound cards if we want all cards work runtime.
Or we have to enable only one of them in dts file as it is designed.
